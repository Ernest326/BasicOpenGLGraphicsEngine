This a simple OpenGL graphics engine which I worked on over the summer when I was 12. 
I worked on this project with the help of the site https://learnopengl.com/ and youtube videos/tutorials
Thanks to this project I learned how graphics are processed through buffers and shaders. I also learned about matrices and how to use them in order to create projections and transformations.

In the future I might go back to this project and remake a more sophisticated version and maybe try to introduce some basic physics, entitylists, and try implement physical-based rendering techniques.
